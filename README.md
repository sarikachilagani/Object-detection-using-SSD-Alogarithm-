# Object-detection-using-SSD-Alogarithm-

Detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape.

Requirements:

1)Python (ver 3.6).

2)Keras (with tensorflow backend).

3)OpenCV2.

4)Numpy.

5)Imutils.

install packages using following commands:

1)pip install opencv2-python

2)pip install imutils

3)Pip install numpy
